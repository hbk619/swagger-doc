Swagger Doc
========

## WORK IN PROGRESS

It's all very hard coded and not well named as this is draft 1
and I'm learning SBT/Scala as I go. It generates Swagger 2.0 JSON.

## Intro

This project allows you to generate swagger json from Akka Http tests.
It's inspired by https://github.com/kodemaniak/akka-http-restdoc which creates
some generic documentation from your tests.

It has 2 components you need:

* An sbt plugin `swagger-doc` to run after tests have completed to generate the single swagger json file
* A trait for running Akka Http tests

## Trait Example

Add the dependency:

`"com.ksquared" %% "swagger-doc-akka" % "0.1"`

Then write a test!

It currently depends on a RootJsonFormat instance to be in scope
to convert the response body to an instance to inspect.
This is an implicit param to the perform method which also
needs the return type of the body.

```

import akka.http.scaladsl.testkit.ScalatestRouteTest
import org.scalatest.{Matchers, WordSpec}
import com.ksquared.swaggerdoc.akka.AkkaHttpDoc

class RoutesSpec extends WordSpec with Matchers
    with ScalatestRouteTest with AkkaHttpDoc {

    "the route" should {
        "post some things" in {
            val body = SomeBody("123")
            setup(Post("/some/url", body)
                .perform[Assertion, PostResponse]("some route") {
                  status shouldEqual OK
                  // rest of assertions
                }
        }
        
        "get some things" in {
            setup(Get("/some/url/3456", ".*([0-9]*)".r("anId")
                .perform[Assertion, SomeItemResponse]("Get some item") {
                    status shouldEqual OK
                    // rest of assertions
                }
        }
    }
}
```

Mixin the AkkaHttpDoc and use the setup function for requests.

Urls with parameters in them:

`setup(req: HttpRequest, pathRegex: Regex)`

The regular expression should contain named groups to allow for
clearer documentation. 

`setup(Get("/some/url/123456/nickname/12345"), ".*([0-9]{6})\\/nickname\\/([0-9]{5})".r("userId", "nickname"))`


## Plugin Example

In `plugins.sbt`

`addSbtPlugin("com.ksquared" % "swagger-doc-generator" % "0.1")`

The `swagger-doc` command will automatically become available.

You can configure the following properties on the swaggerDocConfig settings key. 

| Property name | Value type    | Default value             | Description |
| ------------- | ----------    | -------------             | ----------- | 
|title          | String        | Test                      | The title to use for the documentation |
|baseUrl        | String        | /                         | The base url all api requests should be served from |
|apiVersion     | String        | 0.0.1                     | Your api version |
|output         | String        | cwd + "/restdoc/generated"| Where to save the final json file to |
|input          | String        | cwd + "/restdoc/generated"| The location the json files generated by each test should live

## Integrate with Swagger UI

In index.html of [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
modify the creation of the SwaggerUI config and set the url to wherever
you want to serve the swagger.json from.

`
window.swaggerUi = new SwaggerUi({
        url: '/swagger.json',
        dom_id: "swagger-ui-container"
})`

## TODO

* Work out how to group routes (tags)
* Figure out a friendlier way to do GET/DELETE requests

### Building the project

`sbt compile`

Or a specific project:

`sbt plugin/compile`

To set a specific scala version:

`sbt '++ 2.11.8 models/compile models/publishLocal`
